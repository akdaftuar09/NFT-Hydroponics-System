# NFT Hydroponics System-final-project-Summary
Even though agriculture has been the source of nutrition since a very a long time, in the past few
decades its quality(of nutriton) has been degraded with accusations of depleting natural resources.
As the world's population is expected to be about 9.8 billion people by 2050, it stares at increasing
food production by at least 70 per cent.

Soil salinity (I.e the degradation of the quality) is one of the most devastating environmental
stresses which causes major reductions in cultivated land area, crop productivity and quality. The
salinity issue has led to grow plants in solution as an alternative method, such as Nutrient Film
Technique (NFT).

This Project is focusing on hydroponic system in which a variety of vegatables/Plants can
be grown. Here we can also are monitor and control important parameters for the healthy plant growth.

To execute this process we uses a few sensors (like PH sensors,EC sensors.etc) . This project
development is designed to provide automatics control of two main parameters for leafy greens
growth. The parameters will be monitored using Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and IoT platform.

Using ESP32 microcontroller board, this project will be able to manages and maintain an optimum
condition for nutrient consumed by the plant. EC and pH value can be controlled using smartphones
via Blynk application, which provides real time changes.

This offers advantage for the user to monitor and control the system with less effort and requires
no presence at the farmed area. The developed system is proven to provide a sufficient nutrient
for plant growth with hassle free built in automatic control and monitoring system.
